This repository contains a Python implementation of a trading strategy using the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator. It demonstrates how to apply the MACD strategy to historical stock data, generate buy and sell signals, and backtest its performance.

The backtest is done using historical data from Yahoo Finance, and the results are visualized with plots showing stock prices, MACD values, buy/sell signals, and the portfolio performance over time.

## Features

- Calculate MACD, Signal Line, and Histogram
- Generate buy and sell signals based on MACD crossovers
- Backtest the strategy with historical stock data
- Visualize the strategy's performance and key trading signals
